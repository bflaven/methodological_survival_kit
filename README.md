# methodological_survival_kit

A Methodological Survival Kit in French.

This tiny methodological survival kit which presents:

- `001_white_desordres_methodo_3.pdf`: A quick overview of understanding the agile Scrum method for project management 

- `002_prez_strategic_thinking_2.pdf`: A complete kit to forge a quick “strategy” / “raison d’être” and above all an actionable strategy. .

- `003_Change_Culture_Hack_for_newbies_3.pdf`:A complete view of my understanding of Corporate Hacking or Culture Hacking which can now be found almost everywhere but which still does the job when it comes to supporting the digital transformation of an entity such as a company or oneself !!!

*In fact, the combination of the two presentations (`001_white_desordres_methodo_3.pdf`, `002_prez_strategic_thinking_2.pdf`) gives you a useful little guideline when the time for entrepreneurship has come.*
